          <p>
                    The first time I met Rohan, he was sitting alone under the big banyan tree in our school playground, scribbling something in his notebook. I was curious, so I walked up to him.
                    "Hey, what are you writing?" I asked, peeking over his shoulder.
                    Rohan quickly shut the notebook and looked at me with wide eyes. "Nothing... just some stories," he mumbled.
                    That was the beginning of our friendship.
                    Over time, I learned that Rohan had a brilliant imagination. He could turn ordinary things into magical adventures. A boring classroom became a spaceship. A rainy day transformed into an exciting treasure hunt. Every moment with him felt like stepping into a new world.
                    We were inseparable. Whether it was sharing lunch, solving riddles, or sneaking out to buy ice cream after school, we did everything together.

We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.

ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT⁠, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.

We are excited to introduce ChatGPT to get users’ feedback and learn about its strengths and weaknesses. During the research preview, usage of ChatGPT is free.
